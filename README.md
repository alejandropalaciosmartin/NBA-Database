# Blazor Web Application: NBA Player Statistics 2014/2015
This repository hosts a web application developed with the Blazor framework of .NET, created as part of a practical exercise during my studies. My colleague Adrian also contributed to this project (you can find his GitHub [here](https://github.com/AdrianLozanoMartinez)). The project's inspiration was the following assignment:

## Getting Started
To run this project, you can try the online demo available at [DEMO](https://alejandropalaciosmartin.github.io/NBADatabase/)

## Practical Free Web Application Assignment
In this practice, we were tasked with developing a web application using Blazor. The application's purpose is to display information on a freely chosen topic. To achieve the highest grade, the application needed to meet the following requirements:

- Have at least 2 views with the ability to navigate between them.
- Include explanatory text about the chosen topic and the source of the data.
- Feature at least one image.
- Include a video.
- Contain a table with the following functionalities:
  - A search feature.
  - Ascending and descending sorting.
  - Pagination.
- Include at least one chart.

### Key Considerations
- The implementation of the requirements should be consistent with the chosen topic and the rest of the application. Irrelevant features will not be considered.
- The use of third-party libraries is allowed, with one exception: the table logic, as specified in the requirements, should be implemented from scratch.
- Data for the application can be obtained from publicly available and free sources, such as Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or APIs.

## Deliverables
The repository contains the complete source code and necessary files for local execution, along with a link to the publicly deployed version. The names of the students who worked on the project are also provided.

Feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or contributions to enhance the code or address any issues. Your input is always welcome to improve this implementation.
